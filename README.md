# Java Blackjack

Java (Console) implementation of Blackjack.

## Background

Wanted to try out what sort of implementation I would come up with purely on my own without looking at anything other than various online Blackjack sources.
This took less than 2 hours include setting up the GitHub and creating the readme.

This implementation just uses the terminal to play at a typical Casino single player Blackjack.
